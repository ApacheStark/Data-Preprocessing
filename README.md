# Data-Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing in R

The following R.files contain guides and templates on data preprocessing using the following packages/functions:
1. dplyr (filter, select, arrange, mutate, and summarise functions, also pipes %>% for 'sentence' like readability in code)
2. tidyr (row and column manipulation)
3. stringr (string/character manipulation)
4. the apply() functions (apply functions to vectors and retrieve an output)
5. lubridate (date manipulation)

Please note: a lot of these templates were created during my time learning R, so the layout is sometimes subject to 'messiness'. Sorry.
